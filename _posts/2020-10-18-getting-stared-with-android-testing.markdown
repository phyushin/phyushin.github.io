# Getting Started With Mobile Testing 

I wanted to do a series of posts to hopefully give a little insight into getting started in the world of mobile testing, and some basic tasks such creating the right test environment to allow you to easily do android testing... so without further ado, let's get started

# Things We'll Need

To get started with android testing the most obvious thing you will need is an android _device_. The good news is this device doesn't have to be a physical device ... that's right! we can use android _virtual_ devices or AVDs to do mobile testing (I sometimes find it easier to use AVDs actually).

For now we're going to work in windows as it's a little easier to get started but feel free to work in Linux or Mac if you like. So firstly we're going to go need Android Studio, the download can be found [here][1]. Go ahead and download and install Android studio - you may even want to write a basic app or two to get a feel for how it fits together - but that's a story for another blog.

Opening up Android Studio we're greeted by something that will look like the following, of course depending on when you're reading this the version might be different.

Go ahead and click the `configure` option at the bottom and select  `avd manager` ![avd manger]({{ site.url }}/assets/getting_started_android_testing/create_new_avd.png)
