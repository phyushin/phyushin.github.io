__What is Mailvelope, and why should I care?__

[Mailvelope][3] is an extension that sits in your web browser normally([chrome][1] or [firefox][2])
and allows you to send and receive encrypted emails with relative ease

__First off - you'll need key pair__

whilst not _strictly_ true - you only _really_ need the public keys of other people to _send_ encrypted emails - you do how ever need your private key if you want to read what you sent or read the replies back

we touched on [how to generate a key pair][4] in the previous blog so
